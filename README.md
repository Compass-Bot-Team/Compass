## Setup
If you want to setup the bot, [I strongly advise you not to.](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=769308147662979122&permissions=2147352567&scope=bot) However, if you really want to, there is a setup guide in the repo as well as a config creator python file. You can go down either route but the setup guide is more documented while the config creator is easier to use and also automatically creates needed DBs. I advise personally to look and use both.
